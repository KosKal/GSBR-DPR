# GSBR-DPR
Julia implementation of the Geometric stick breaking and the Dirichlet process reconstruction models [*]. The program avoids vectorization leading to faster execution times in Julia.

Folder "Polynomial" contains software used for the simulations presented in the paper [*].
Folder "Henon" contains software used for the extension of the GSBR model to higher lag terms.

The algorithm works with Julia 0.6.4.
